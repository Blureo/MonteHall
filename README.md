Statistical Model of the Monte Hall Problem


The Monte Hall Problem is a brain-teaser with the following premise:

You are a game show contestant and are told that out of 3 doors, behind two are goats and behind one is a prize. For this explanation I will use the labels Door A, Door B, and Door C. You are asked to pick a door. Say, for example, you pick door A. After picking your door, Monte Hall, the host, opens one of the remaining two doors; one that has a goat behind it. He opens door B. There are now two doors: your original pick (door A) and Door C. Monte Hall then asks if you would like to change the door you picked to the other door.

Statistics would suggest that the first time you picked a door, you had a 33% chance of guessing the correct door. Once Monte Hall narrows the choice to two doors, revealing a "wrong door," it is actually in your best interest to change the door you picked. Because your first guess was 66% likely to be wrong (33% likely to be correct), and a wrong door was revealed, the remaining door has a 66% chance of being correct. Thus, it is always in your best interest to switch doors after choosing your first.
